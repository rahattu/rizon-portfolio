            <p>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified
                by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org,
                google.com, and amazon.com.
                Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
                entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site,
                which often starts with a home page.</p>

            <p>NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new
                agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space
                science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
